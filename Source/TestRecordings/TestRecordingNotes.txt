// These are all recordings of some Beatles songs from youtube.

// All the teensy recordings were done by starting the recording, submitting the data on the website which causes it to play it, and then stopping the recordings.
// So there is some time on either end where there shouldn't be anything, then a pop, and then nothing again.
// When I play it from the teensy, however, it is more the opposite where there is some noise and then it stops and then noise again.
// When we just play it from the website, we just get a pop for the signal.
teensyV.RAW - is a recording of an output from website with volume lowered
teensyC.RAW - one recording from website with another one added directly after it
teensy.RAW - a simple recording from website

// Notes:
// We did the volume one to see if it would be any better not being blasted, but I doubt this affects the recording, and just the playing back on the teensy so there may not be a real difference.
// Both the Con files mean that instead of deleting the file and making a new one, we just opened it again and continue to record to the end of it.
// This was added because we are planing on storing all of the data we record in one big file, one after the other, so I figured I would include it to see if anything strange came of it.
