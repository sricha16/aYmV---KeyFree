			<strong> <font size = "4">Tips</font></strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not change tabs when you are storing or retrieving information. It causes the data to be slowed and may affect the integrity of the data stored or retrieved.</li>
				<li>While it is not necessary to verify the information after it has been stored, we highly recomend doing so.</li>
				<li>Use a strong password for you encryption key. If an attacker gets this, they then have all of your other passwords!</li>
				<li>Generate random passwords with as many variables and as long as the application will let you use. Since you do not have to remember it, make it complicated so it is secure.</li>
			</ul>
